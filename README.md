# LifeAndChoices
This app is my final project for Android Programming subject at 6th semester. I made this app because i have been thinking about making a
story quiz app where there are condition when player choose another different answer, different result.

I used points system for this apps, where the user choose "good" answer, then the point will be increase +5. When user choose neutral answer,
then the point won't be increase =0. If the user choose the "bad" answer, then the point will be decrease -5 or -10.

At the end of the story, there are 3 results, and it all depends by user's choices. If the user choose a lot of good answer, then the result
will be good ending. If the user choose a lot of neutral answer, then the result will be neutral. If the user always choose the bad answer, then the
result of the ending will be so bad.

Build this app, i used Android Studio 2021.3.1.
